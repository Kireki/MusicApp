MusicApp
========
A project for uni diploma.

General Idea
========
Grab music likes from user's Facebook. Get similar artists by feeding Facebook data to last.fm. Play tracks of those artists via SoundCloud.

Future perspectives
========
Get rid of last.fm calls and suggest tracks based on what other users listened to.
